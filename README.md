	and a pygame window will appear (as long as pygame has been installed),
	with a grid displayed on the screen. You can draw to the grid by
	clicking and holding anywhere on the screen. If you would like to run
	the game of life simulation go ahead and press the space button
	upon which the game will start. It will run indefinitely so make sure
	to close out of the window once you are satisfied
